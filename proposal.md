## **Project Proposal**
# *By Alice Minkov-Temis*

## Big Idea (MVP)
The main idea of my project will be creating a food delivery application (ex. DoorDash, GrubHub) for a fake restaurant. My MVP will be creating a Flask app that focuses on getting user input and generating a response. Essentially, my application will be based around the following: 
1. Allow users to input their food order, such as the name of the dish and quantity.
2. Based on the user's input, generate a response that confirms their order. For example, displaying a message like "Order received: [quantity] x [dish name]. Total Price: $XXX"
3. Add the option for users to input their address. The app can calculate the distance between user's address and your restaurantâ€™s (fake) place and add the deliver fee accordingly.

Once I finish the above MVP, I'll gradually add more complexity to the app later on, however, first I want to focus on the above plan. 

## Learning Objectives
My learning objectives for this project is as follows:
1. To create a successful app that achieves all my goals and learn how to seamlessly implement Flask and Python code together. 
2. Continue to utilize ChatGPT in an effective manner regarding debugging and other code problems.
3. Create a dynamic website that works effectively with user input. 
4. Continue to build upon my problem-solving skills by breaking down the project into small parts.
   
## Implementation Plan
Currently, I'm not 100% certain what specific libraries I might need. Considering implementation, I will first need to create a dictionary to store my fake resturant data (name, address, etc.). I'll also create a restuarnat menu dictionary with prices. Then, I'll create functions where a user an input their order (such as dishes and quantity) and will receive a confirmation message (like a receipt). Lastly, users will have to input their address and a function will calculate the distance from the restuarant location to calculate the appropriate delivery fee (potentially need to load a 'math' library). 

## Project Schedule
**Week 1 (11/9-11/18)**: 
- Figure out what data/ how to integrate it into Python
- Need to create a dictionary probably for the restaurant data
**Week 2 (11/19-11/25)**: 
-Load in necessary libraries/packages
-Start creating Python functions for users to input and generate desired outputs 
-Focus on getting the MVP achieved in its basic form
**Week 3 (11/26-12/02)**: 
-Integrate Flask with Python code 
-Start building website
-Potentially add complexities into MVP
**Week 4 (12/03-12/09)**: 
-Finalize Python code and wesbite
-Tie up any loose ends/edits and add any necessary changes

## Risks and Limitations
One potential risk is making sure the user can input their orders and get the desired results back on the website. The largest challenge will be integrating Flask with my Python code to create a functional and dynamic website. 

## Additional Course Content
I think everything we have learned from this course so far will help. I am currently unsure what additional course content will be useful, but once I start my project more in-depth, I will gather more concepts that will be helpful.
